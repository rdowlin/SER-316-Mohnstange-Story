I was in Berlin at the Flughafen, drinking a local hefeweizen called "Das Eltz" when I saw Rammstein walking through. 
They airport bar isn't like the Ratskellers I had recently visited, everything is overpriced, including the beer. 
Rammstien sat down the airport bar, just two tables away, they looked hung over and ordered enough Bratwurst to feed all of Belgium and the beer in the spot, und da brach die HÃ¶lle los. 
Brot and Bratwurst all flew through the air as everyone drank free beer. 
Who am I to stop the mosh pit or forgo wettbewerbsfaehig drinking? Besides there was a pretty girl in a Dirndel who had caught my eye. 
She told me she worked in Baeckerei making Gebaeck. 
No wonder she smelled of Apfelkuchen. 
Then the world started to spin, and a moment later I found myself in a BMW cruising down Hauptstrasse.
Who needs the plane when Germany has such great trains. 
It was quite the night, truly a riot. 
Half way through the night and nearly blackout, I was wearing someone else's Lederhose and dancing in a Schloss. 
The pictures I have tell an outsanding tale. 
And that's why I didn't finish the assignment.  
I then made the decision to visit Eltz Castle in order to learn some amusing facts about it. I learned that Eltz has hosted a number of famous visitors, and I am now eager to become one of them.
And after getting approval from 33 generations of ownwer I now has decided to eat Doner kebab.
It's now very hot but all the klimaanlage are broken.
I need find a biergarten to cool down with more drinks and maybe an apfelkuchen.
But if I do find one I hope they serve food, it would go well with some Brot.
Come to think of it, I have had too much Brot, time for some sauerkraut!
